# Naming Conventions
Projects and libraries should follow Python's [PEP8 naming conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names):
>Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.
> 
>When an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying Python module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented) interface, the C/C++ module has a leading underscore (e.g. _socket).
